## Solar monitoring

**The UK**

Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC) 1 of 3 prediction centres.
Solar storms considered national risk by UK gov since 2011.

MOSWOC Forecasts include:
- Solar wind / Geomagnetic activity
- Solar radiation
- Solar imagery
- Aurora forecasts
- Impact on terrestrial comms (signals that pass throu the atmousphere)
- Impact on satellite comms

MOSWOC Notifications:
- Radio blackout alerts
- Proton flux warnings
- Electron flux warnings

MOSWOC Forecasts updated every 1 min.

## Solar activity

**Coronal mass ejection**

CMEs are expulsions of plasma and B-field from the corona. They carry coronal material and embedded B-fields stronger than background solar wind. 250-3000 km/s.

They occur when intertwined magnetic field structures (flux ropes) become too stressed and realign into a less tense configuration - Magnetic reconnection.

CMEs observed by Climate observatorys at Lagrangian points. They can measure increases in interplanetary magnetic field strength (IMF), solar wind speed and denisty giving Earth a 15-60 minute warning.

**Solar Radiation Storms**

SRSs occur when large magnetic eruptions cause CMEs & solar flares to accelerate charged particles in solar atmous to high vels; most commonly protons. Protons penetrate the magnetosphere and are guided down B-field lines and penetrate the atmosphere at the poles.

 NOAA Space Weather Scale: S1-S5

"""The start of a Solar Radiation Storm is defined as the time when the flux of protons at energies â‰¥ 10 MeV equals or exceeds 10 proton flux units (1 pfu = 1 particle*cm-2*s-1*ster-1)."""

**Geomagnetic storms**

Major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere where there is a highly efficient exchange of energy from solar wind into space surrouding Earth.

Solar wind conditions effective for generating GMSs are long sustaining (several hours) but most importantly a **southward** directed solar wind i.e., solar wind moving in opposite direction to Earth's B-field.

Powerful GMSs can cause disruption and harm to navigational systems and create induced currents in power grids and pipelines. 

**Solar activity**

Solar activity measured by the number of sunspots, follows 11-year cycle between maxima. Cycle includes 7-year period of probably solar flare events.
